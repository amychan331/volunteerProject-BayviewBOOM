<strong>BayviewBOOM Wordpress Website:</strong>

This stores the work I did with John Weiss for his non-profit, BayviewBOOM.
We were working on the organization's website, which was created via Wordpress.
While we tried to rely mostly on plugins without shortcode so future non-tech users can monitor it without problem,
there are several issues we encountered that we decided would be better solved via coding.
This repo contains the Wordpress functions and plugin modifications that John and I did.
